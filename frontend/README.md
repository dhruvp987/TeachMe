## Getting Started with Development

If it doesn't already exist, make an .env.development file. Add the line NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL="https://localhost:8000" to it. This is the URL that FastAPI listens on when you run the FastAPI backend server in development mode.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
